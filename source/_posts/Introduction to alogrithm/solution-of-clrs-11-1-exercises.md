### Exercises 11.1-2

> A ***bit vector*** is simply an array of bits (0's and 1's). A bit vector of
> length *m* takes much less space than an array of *m* pointers. Describe how
> to use a bit vector to Represent a Dynamic Set of Distinct Elements with no 
> Satellite Data. Dictionary Operations Should Run in *O*(1) Time.

**Solution(I get the result from [Rip’s blog][], The original text is
here for ease of reference.):**

> Using a bit vector of length m, as our direct-address table to represent the
> dynamic set.Here m bits tags m slots of the table. The elements in the 
> dynamic set is stored in the direct-address table itself. If slot k is
> allocated, bit k is 0. If slot k contains no element, bit k is 1.
>
> #### Bit Vector
>
> The free-space list is often implemented as a bit map or bit vector. If a
> block is free, the bit is 1. If a block is allocated, the bit is 0. Assume
> the following blocks are allocated, the rest free: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11,
> 12, 13, 17, 18, 25, 27 .The free-space bit map would
> be: 0011110011111100011000000111000000…
>
> Adavantages of this approach include:   
> · Relatively simple   
> · Efficient to find the first free blocks or n consecutive free blocks
> on the disk.
>
> Bit maps are useful only when it can be kept in main memory. But, as disks get
> larger, this is hard to do. 1.3 gigabyte disk with 512 byte blocks would need 
> a bit map of over 310k to track its free blocks. Clustering the blocks in
> intervals of foul reduces this number to 78k per disk.

### Exercises 11.1-3

> Suggest how to implement a direct-address table in which the keys of stored
> elements do not need to be distinct and the elements can have satellite data.
> All three dictionary operations (INSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH) should run in 
> *O*(1) time. (Don't forget that DELETE takes as an argument a pointer to an 
> object to be deleted, not a key.)

**Solution:**可以直接用链表来解决碰撞问题。对于搜索的话可以返回链表的指针，根据题
目的条件来看，对于两个用户提供的两个key相同的object我们是无法区分的，因此只能返回
一组key相同的objecet让用户用自己的方法来区分。

### Exercises 11.1-4

> We wish to implement a dictionary by using direct addressing on a *huge* array.
> At the start, the array entries may contain garbage, and initializing the
> entire array is impractical because of its size. Describe a scheme for 
> implementing a direct-address dictionary on a huge array. Each stored object
> should use *O*(1) space; the operations SEARCH, INSERT, and DELETE should
> take *O*(1) time each; and the initialization of the data structure should take
> *O*(1) time. (*Hint:*Use an additional stack, whose size is the number of keys
> actually stored in the dictionary, to help determine whether a given entry in 
>the huge array is valid or not.)

**Solution:**一直没想出好的办法来解决这个问题，今天看《算法导论教师手册》有这个题
的解答。觉得它的数据结构的思路比较巧妙：字典中每个元素带有一个索引，表示关于该元
素的的key存储在辅助栈中的位置。而辅助栈用数组实现，因此可以随机访问。辅助栈中存储
所有存在于字典中的元素的key ，于是形成了一个所谓validating cycle。要判断从字典中
直接读取到的元素是不是需要的数据，只需要取出该元素中的索引，判断这个索引是否有效
（大于栈底而小于栈顶），然后通过索引获取栈中的key ,与自己需要的元素的key比较看是
否相等即可以。相等表示该数据是要找的数据，否则不是。显而易见，通过这个数据结构模
型来进行SEARCH, INSERT都为*O*(1)。至于DELETE 操作，需要将被删除的数据在栈中的key
与栈顶存储的key交换后再删除，同样可以达到*O*(1)，要注意的是删除过程中，需要更新与
原栈顶中key相关元素的索引。
